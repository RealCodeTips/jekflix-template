I've been a developer for about 6 years now, and I love my job. I've found a decent company, an awesome working environment, and I actually enjoy being a software engineer.

Unfortunately, in this industry, there can be an expectation that you'll be doing it in your own time, on your own projects, to keep up with new technologies.

Well, I'm here to tell you it's not a requirement to being successful.

Sure I've done my own projects, with varying levels of success, but they were born out of interest not requirement.

I have a young family, so any time not spent working goes on them. I could have probably learnt {insert newest JavaScript framework here}, but personal life is important.

Put whatever time you can into it, and don't feel guilty if you can't give more.
