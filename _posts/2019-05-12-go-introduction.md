> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Go is a relatively new language; coming into existence in 2009 at Google. It is [statically typed](https://codetips.co.uk/intermediate/translation-and-types/) and it's a [compiled language](https://codetips.co.uk/intermediate/translation-and-types/).

It is a backend language, which means it's used to write applications that sit in the background performing tasks that other services (e.g. websites) ask of it.

There are a lot of backend languages already out there, but a lot of developers are choosing to learn and use Go due to its simplicity and speed.

Another reason we've chosen to teach you Go is the learning curve. It's a much easier language to learn, due to its simplicity, than other backend languages.

You can download Go by going to their [downloads](https://golang.org/dl/) page and clicking the appropriate box for your platform.

![Go Versions](/assets/images/content/go_introduction_go_versions.jpg)

Once you've downloaded/installed Go you can verify your installation by running the following command:

```bash
go version
```



If the command outputs a version, you'll need to install a Code Editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)) and then you're good to move on to the next articles.

If you get stuck and need some help, drop us a comment and we'll try to help you.
