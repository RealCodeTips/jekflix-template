Today, we're happy to announce three important changes to CodeTips.

---

## No More Ads

We've come to the decision to remove all the Ads from CodeTips. Although we received no negative feedback, we feel they were getting in the way and we didn't think there was enough benefits to keeping them.

Instead, we've launched a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/realcodetips) page. If you'd like to contribute, we'd be very grateful, but there is no pressure whatsoever.

## Comment Integration

We've added Disqus integration, so you'll be able to interact with the CodeTips writers directly through their articles.

## No More Journeys

When CodeTips started, we wanted to provide a place for absolute beginners to come and learn the fundamentals of programming.

Originally, we thought the best way to do this was to create a specific "journey" that each programming language would follow. That meant that learning Go and JavaScript would follow a very similar path, and should help our readers understanding.

We are now changing that plan. We believe the articles we have already created provide a solid foundation for anybody wanting to pick up the basics, and now we're going to focus on each language individually. Our writers will now be able to create the content they want to create, for the language(s) they want to create it for. This means that our Go articles will move at a completely different pace to our Python articles, and may be on completely different topics, but we believe we'll be able to provide more quality articles this way.

Basically, we're moving towards a more traditional "blog" approach. This week you might read about Go pointers, next week you might learn the difference between the double equals (`==`) and triple equals (`===`) operators in JavaScript.

What does this mean for our readers? Hopefully this means more quality articles, on topics that you want to read about.
